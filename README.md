This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, which attempts to access a user based on an ID parameter without validating the ID.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
